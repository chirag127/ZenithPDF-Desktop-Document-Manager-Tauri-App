        A.  reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only;
        B.  produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.

Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to enable You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
